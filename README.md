# Statistical learning and deep learning
This is a graduate-level statistical learning and deep learning course that introduces several machine learning models and some basic deep learning models. This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments.

Professor: [Hsin-Min, Lu](http://www.im.ntu.edu.tw/~lu/), graduate institution of information management @ National Taiwan University

## Course contents
- KNN
- Regression
- Linear models for classification
- Model evaluation
- Dimensionality reduction
- Tree-based models
- Deep learning basics
- Deep feedforward network
- Regularization for deep learning models
- Optimization for deep learning models
- Convolution networks

Final score: 101.8 / 100 (A+)

## Homework assignments
The homeworks of this class usually require us to build machine learning models from scratch (with only numpy and pandas). Thus, students need to derive equations of models and typed in the jupyer botebooks with LaTex syntax.

- HW1: KNN regressions, hyperparameter tuning, lasso regression
- HW2: data preprocessing, ROC, AUC, Logistic regression with L2 regularization
- HW3: Feature engineering, stacking, data visualization, dimensinality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- HW4: Deep neural networks
- HW5: Convolution neural networks, SDG, Adam optimizer, confusion matrix

Please refer to the jupyter notebooks in each homework directory for details.

## Final projects 
- We participated in a Kaggle competition - Credit Card Fraud Detection.
